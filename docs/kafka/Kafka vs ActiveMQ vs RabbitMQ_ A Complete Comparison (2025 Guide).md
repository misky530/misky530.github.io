# Kafka vs ActiveMQ vs RabbitMQ_ A Complete Comparison (2025 Guide)

Hi, everyone. Welcome back to my channel, take recording. Today we will discuss the differences between Kafka active mq and rabbit mq these three giants domain are the world of messaging in event driven architectures, but they are designed for a very different purpose. In this video, I will break down their key differences in use cases and help you decide which one should you choose in your next project. Is stay tuned till the end, because I will also see a real world example where each of them signs. 

说话人1 00:46First, let's understand what these systems actually do. Message queues are the like post office. You drop MSS and someone else pick it up. They help different services in your system, communicate asynchronous li, meaning they don't have to wait each others. 

说话人1 01:11Now, let's quickly define our three players, active mqa traditional message broker, build on James, that is Java. Message service is standard rabbit mq another broker, lightweight and very flexible based on amqp protocol. Kafka, it distributed is streaming platform, built for a high throughput and real time event is streaming. How there differs. Let's understand with architectural expect active mq active mq is broker based architecture designed around GMS based systems. Reliable, but best for the is smaller is scale applications. Rabbit, mq it is also broker based architecture. Masses routing in super flexible with concept like exchanges, skills, and bindings. Kafka, it is distributed log system. Messages are restored in partitions, and consumers need to read at their own place. 

说话人1 02:23Now, let's understand the differences with performance aspect. Active mq active mq is good for Enterprise APP, but slower as compared to others. Rabbit mq, it handles thousands up messages per second. Great for the background jobs. Kafka, it handles millions of messages per second. Bill for the big data pipelines, analytics in real time is streaming. Here, Kafka is a Top performer and second number, rabbit, mq and third number is active mq now, let's understand with masses retains an aspect in active mq and rabbit, mq masses are deleted once consumed. 

说话人1 03:16While Kafka messages are persist under disk for a set time. Even after being consumed, this makes a great for the replaying data. 

说话人1 03:30Now, let's see the differences with the use case aspect, active mq it is super fit for the legacy systems, Enterprise messaging with the same space architecture. It is a simple queue if needed rabbit, mq it is super useful in task use, background processing, job scheduling, communication between Micro services. Kafka, it is ultimate fit for the event is streaming. Real time analytics, log aggregation in handling massive data pipeline in super fast manner. 

说话人1 04:14Now let's put this into context with real world use cases, active mq if you need banking apps, where you need a reliable messaging with Java based systems, rabbit, mq it is a fit like e commerce are the processing where each other triggers tasks like inventory, check, payment and notifications, Kafka, net flicks, Uber, and LinkedIn. They all use Kafka for real time data streaming, recommendation engines, and event driven architectural systems. 

说话人1 04:56So how do you decide if you are working with legacy Enterprise apps, use active mq if you need simple and reliable task, use go with private mq if your system need to handle real time, data is streaming at a scale, go with Kafka. Kafka is super winner for the performance perspective. Now, let's understand Kafka versus active mq versus rabbit mq with comparison table. Type. Kafka is distributed extreme platform. Active mq is traditional message broker, where rabbit mq is masses broker protocol support. Kafka have custom its own Kafka protocol, while active mq uses GMS item, mqttamqp protocol. And rabbit q uses amqp by default, and mqtt atom and sttp protocol. Macy's model. Kafka uses publisher and subscriber is stream based model. Active mq users . to point and pop and sub model. Rabbit mq uses q base PUB in sub routing where exchanges model performance and its speed. Kaka is very high there, so millions of messages per second. Active mq is medium label performance. That is Enterprise grid. Rabbit mq is slower than Kafka and active mq it is lightweight. Message is stories. In Kafka, messages is stored for a configuration time. A replay support in active mq messages remove once consumed. And in rabbit mq, it also deleted messages once consumed, is scalability. Kafka is excellent in the scalability and active. Mq is limited. And rabbit mq is good, but not as a scalable as Kafka. Reliability. Kafka has high reliability and high fault problems. Active mq is reliable, mature Enterprise support. Rabbit mq is also reliable support clustering. Best for Kafka is best for. Real time is streaming big data pipeline in analytics, logs, active mq it is support for the Enterprise integration, legacy systems with zms rabbit, mq it is fit for the task use. Jobs are dealing Micro services, communication examples are fuse, net flicks. Uber LinkedIn uses Kafka banking apps, legacy Java system uses active mqe commerce, other processing. Background jobs, uses rabbit mq. That's it. If you found this video helpful, don't forget to like share and subscribe for more tech insights videos.
