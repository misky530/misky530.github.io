The Concepts section helps you learn about the parts of the Kubernetes system and the abstractions Kubernetes uses to represent your [cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-cluster), and helps you obtain a deeper understanding of how Kubernetes works.

------

##### [Overview](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/)

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

##### [Cluster Architecture](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/)

The architectural concepts behind Kubernetes.

##### [Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/)

Technology for packaging an application along with its runtime dependencies.

##### [Workloads](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/)

Understand Pods, the smallest deployable compute object in Kubernetes, and the higher-level abstractions that help you to run them.

##### [Services, Load Balancing, and Networking](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/)

Concepts and resources behind networking in Kubernetes.

##### [Storage](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/)

Ways to provide both long-term and temporary storage to Pods in your cluster.

##### [Configuration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/)

Resources that Kubernetes provides for configuring Pods.

##### [Security](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/)

Concepts for keeping your cloud-native workload secure.

##### [Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/)

Manage security and best-practices with policies.

##### [Scheduling, Preemption and Eviction](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/)



##### [Cluster Administration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/)

Lower-level detail relevant to creating or administering a Kubernetes cluster.

##### [Windows in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/windows/)

Kubernetes supports nodes that run Microsoft Windows.

##### [Extending Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/)

Different ways to change the behavior of your Kubernetes cluster
